### Notes ###

* Characters' health points, attack powers and counter attack powers are randomly generated at the beginning of the game.
    * After the player wins the game, the above numbers will be randomly generated again on reset.
    * If you the player loses or ties with the defende, the numbers will stay the same. Try to figure out a strategy to win.
* If after an attack, both player and defender's health points fall negative, the player and the defender tie the game. You will need to reset. The health point, attack power and counter attack power stay the same in this case.  

### Enjoy! ###
